# MELD

Official repository of MELD (Masked Element-wise Learnable Diffusion) - Learning Flexible Forward Trajectories for Masked Molecular Diffusion.

## Overview

MELD is a masked diffusion model geared for molecular generation that resolves the state-clashing problem through learnable forward trajectories, showing robust performance in both conditional and unconditional generation.
